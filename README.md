# Project Euler Solutions

## Introduction
This repository contains solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). Some solutions are written in C++ and others in Python. For selected problems, I also provide mathematical proofs written in LaTeX to justify and explain my solutions or to analyze the time/space complexity.

## Repository Structure
- `Cpp Solutions/`: Directory containing solutions written in C++.
- `Python Solutions/`: Directory containing solutions written in Python.
- `LaTeX Source Code/`: Directory containing LaTeX documents (along with PDFs for easier reading) with mathematical proofs for selected problems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- For C++ solutions: A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
- For Python solutions: Python 3.x.
- For viewing proofs: A LaTeX editor or viewer (e.g., TeXShop, Overleaf).
